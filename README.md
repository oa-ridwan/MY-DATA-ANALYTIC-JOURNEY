In this project, I used the datasets from a group of bike purchasers behavior. The data includes, marital status, age, gender, income, occupation, etc.
I successfully cleaned the data and created my working sheet, then I created pivot table and proceeded to having a dashboard where you I presented the data in a simpler form.
